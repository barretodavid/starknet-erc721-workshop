# ERC721 Workshop Guide

This repository contains the solutions to the exercises presented in the [ERC721 Workshop](https://github.com/starknet-edu/starknet-erc721) created by StarkWare to teach developers how to use StarkNet.

I also wrote detailed guides on how to solve each exercise step by step on my [blog](https://david-barreto.com/)
